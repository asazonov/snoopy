Overview of Use
===============
In Snoopy, the manual quality control is split into sessions where each session consists of:

*. A set of sequence files (BAM, CRAM) which you want to visualise simultanously.
*. A list of variant locations (SNPs or CNVs) which you want to review in the sequence files.

A typical session is a trio (mother, father and offspring) at some called de novo sites. Note that you don't need to have more than one sequence file if you are concerned with only a single individual. Broadly, the steps to using Snoopy are:

1. Select sequence data (BAM, CRAM) and variant file.
2. Review each session.
3. Produce and download report of quality control decisions/snapshots.

This process will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

Data Access
===========
There are several ways to access data, depending on which of the modes you choose to use Snoopy: manual or batch. In manual mode, you create a single session select one file (sequence data, list of variants) at a time. In this mode you are limited to viewing one set of sequence files at a time. In batch mode, you upload a JSON file specifying a batch of sessions which will be automatically parsed and prepared for viewing. Depending on which mode of use, Snoopy can gain access to files in a few modalities:


Local
-----
It is possible to load files which reside on your local machine and this will also provide the fastest data access peformance. However, there are limitations. Firstly, as Dalliance, the underlying genome browser, does not yet provide full support for CRAM, it is only possible to upload BAM files. Secondly, you will be limited to only the manual mode.

Local File Server
-----------------
Snoopy includes a local server which overcomes some of the limitations of local file access. That is, because your files can be accessed by a url (e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:8084/static/User/bob/case.bam`) you can use batch mode to load your session. You will be limited to BAM files however.

HTTP/S
------
If your files exist on a remote HTTP/S server, you will be able to access in either manual or batch mode. You will be limited to BAM files however.


SSH bridge
----------
If your files exist on a remote server but cannot be accessed by HTTP/S, you can use Snoopy's SSH bridge which works by

1. Establish SSH connection to remote machine.
2. Dalliance will make an HTTP/S request to Snoopy's local server for a specific sequence file (x.bam) a at a specific location (chr:start-end).
3. HTTP/S request is parse and turned into a samtools commdand: samtools view x.bam chr:start-end
4. Samtools command is sent, via SSH, to remote machine
5. Output of samtools command is parsed to JSON
6. JSON is proveded to Dalliance

As samtools is being used, this method has the benefit of being able to read CRAM files.

Starting Up
===========







Load Your Files
---------------
Load BAM files, BAI files and a text file (.txt) with variant locations, one per line. The variant text file can list both SNPs and CNVs. SNPs can be in any of the following formats:

* chr:location
* chr-location
* chr,location
* chr location

The format for CNVs is as SNPs except the location consists of two numbers. For example, a CNV location may be 16:start-end.

You can repeatedly press Load More Files, that is, you don't have to select all of your files from a single open file dialog. Once you have loaded all of your files, click  Start Quality Control
Loading a batch of remote files

You can load a batch of remote BAM files and a variant file by listing them in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. JSON files have a dictionary like structure (key:value) which makes them useful for transferring data that can be easily read by many programming languages. The template of a JSON file that Snoopy expects is found below:

BATCH_FILENAME.json
{
    "sessions" : [
    {
        "variant_locations": "PATH/TO/VARIANT_FILE.TXT",
        "bams": [
            "PATH/TO/BAM_1",
            "PATH/TO/BAM_2",
            ...
            "PATH/TO/BAM_n"
        ]
    },
    {
        "variant_locations": "PATH/TO/VARIANT_FILE.TXT",
        "bams": [
            "PATH/TO/BAM_1",
            "PATH/TO/BAM_2",
            ...
            "PATH/TO/BAM_n"
        ]
    }
}
                                
In the template you have the freedom to change whatever is capitalised but you must leave the keys (variant_locations, bams) alone. The paths can be relative to your home directory ~/... or absolute /lustre/scratch113/.... There is no need to include the https://web-lustre-01... as this is automically prefixed. Lastly, quotation marks must wrap all keys and values.

Note that in batch mode, the JSON file can only point at remote files. This is unavoiadable as local files have to be explicitly loaded into web browser.
Quality Control

At this point you will see the Dalliance genomve viewer with your BAM files loaded, with the labels being the filenames. By default, differenes between the read and the reference are shown while matches are colored: plus strand is salmon; negative strand is pastel blue. The first variant from your text file will located be in the center and highlighted. Make a decision about this variant and advance to the next by clicking one of Not a Variant   Uncertain  Variant  To go back you can either click  Previous or select from the drop down list any variant site from your text file. The drop down list also displays your previous QC decision with the symbols listed in the table below.
Symbol	QC Decision
✗	Not a Variant
?	Uncertain
✓	Variant As you progress through your variants you will notice the status bar growing to reflect this.
QC Review File

When you have reached the final candidate variant, you will be asked if you would like to download the QC decisions. Note that you can download your progress before this point (i.e. you haven't reviewed all of the variants) by clicking on the download icon . When prompred, provide a filename and this will be downloaded onto your machine as a text file. The results file has the following format
date and time of report creation
BAM filename 1
BAM filename 2
.
.
.

chr:variant location 1 QC decision
chr:variant location 2 QC decision
.
.
.
Where QC decision has the following encoding.
Code	QC Decision
-1	Not a Variant
0	Uncertain
1	Certain Variant
-99	No Decision Made
Restart

To restart at any time (which will lose all work unless you have downloaded your progress) click .
